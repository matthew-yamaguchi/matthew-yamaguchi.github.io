# Frameworks - The Deal Breaker #

## First Impressions ##
Imagine you have an upcoming interview for a job you applied for.  One of the first things you may think of is, "what do I wear?"  Generally, you'll pick out a business or business-casual outfit because you want to impress the interviewer.  Everyone knows that first impressions matter.

The same goes for websites.  When someone goes on a website, whether or not they stay often depends on the aesthetics of the site.  Your site may have the information that someone is looking for, but if that person is having troubles looking for the "more information" menu they'll probably leave to find their answers elsewhere.

This is where User Interface frameworks can help.

## UI Frameworks? How does that help? ##

When I started learning HTML and CSS a few weeks ago, I was flustered.  It was hard to remember all the keywords and how to implement them to get my webpage to display the way I wanted.  Then, I learned about Semantic UI.  It uses natural language in its code.  For example, if I wanted to display a centered image on my webpage, I would type something like:

```
<img class="small centered image" src="sampleimage.jpg">
```

Using HTML and CSS, I would have to write something like:
```
<img style="width: 100px; height: 100px;" alt="Sample" src="sampleimage.jpg" align="middle">
```
