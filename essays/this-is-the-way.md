When we were kids, people would always ask what we wanted to be when we grew up.  You would often hear other kids say with conviction, "I want to be a fire fighter," "I want to be a doctor," or "I want to be a teacher."  As we shifted into our high school years, we became hesitant when answering that question.  We considered many possibilities but we were unsure of we really desired to do.  I was one of these people.

Around the winter of 2015 I sent in my application to the University of Hawaii at Manoa and declared myself a computer science student.  I was unsure of what to expect within this field as I had no prior experience in programming.  I was scared that I would have to change my major many times before I finally found something I liked.  This would not be the case.  

A few weeks into the fall semester in 2016, I knew that I loved computer science.  For the first time in my life, I enjoyed doing assignments for school.  Even if it was the simplest of programs like "Hello World," it felt great to see the final product run.  My first semester in college sparked my interest in becoming a software programmer.  I want to be able to create programs that can make people happier and enhance their quality of life.  Something along the lines of game development or app development would be interesting.

To get there, I must grow as a programmer.  I think a strong programmer should be able to understand many programming languages.  By working and understanding the fundamentals of programming, I will be able to do this.  Another trait that a great programmer should have is the ability to work with a team.  A group of people that collaborate and work in synergy will have the tools necessary to accomplish difficult tasks.  I know what I need to do, I know that this is the way.
