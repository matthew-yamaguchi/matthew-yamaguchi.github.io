##What are dumb questions?##

We've all had a teacher or a professor who's said, "Don't be afraid to ask questions.  There are no dumb questions."  Everytime I hear this, I always think about the validity of this statement.  Recently, I asked one of my friends, "do dumb questions exist?"  He replied, "Yes, the question you just asked was a dumb question."  I suppose I set myself up there.

So what constitutes a dumb question?  If you were the responder, what would make you think, "I can't believe they asked me that."  One thing that comes to mind is a question with an obvious answer.  If you are able to find the answer to your problem within a manual or on the first page of a Google search, then it might be a bad question to ask.  Another trait of a poor question is vagueness.  When you ask a question, it's usually in the hopes of receiving a response.  If your question makes it difficult for the respondent to understand what you wish to know, then it might be a bad question.

Here are a few examples of bad questions from Stack Overflow:
