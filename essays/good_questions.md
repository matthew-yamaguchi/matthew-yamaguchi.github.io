## What are dumb questions? ##

We've all had a teacher or a professor who's said, "Don't be afraid to ask questions.  There are no dumb questions."  Everytime I hear this, I always think about the validity of this statement.  Recently, I asked one of my friends, "do dumb questions exist?"  He replied, "Yes, the question you just asked was a dumb question."  I suppose I set myself up there.

So what constitutes a dumb question?  If you were the responder, what would make you think, "I can't believe they asked me that."  One thing that comes to mind is a question with an obvious answer.  If you are able to find the answer to your problem within a manual or on the first page of a Google search, then it might be a bad question to ask.  Another trait of a poor question is vagueness.  When you ask a question, it's usually in the hopes of receiving a response.  If your question makes it difficult for the respondent to understand what you wish to know, then it might be a bad question.

This question was not a question, but rather a request for someone to do their work.  As expected, many people were not very happy to see this type of question pop up on Stack Overflow. 

## How can we ask good questions? ##

We know a few traits that can make a question dumb, so how do we change that same question to make it a good one?  A good question will:
* Be clear so the person responding knows what the issue is and how to help
* Be polite, as we should show courtesy to those who are spending the time to consider an answer
* Show that you've put some effort into finding a solution to your question

There are many other traits that can make a good question, but I believe these are some of the crucial details.

### Here is an example of a good question from Stack Overflow: ###

Notice how this question is clear and the problem is described well.  This person has also shown that they put in effort to find a solution.

This response was given within two minutes of the post being created. The questioner marked this as the best of the 16 answers on the page and this number doesn't include the comments to each answer.
