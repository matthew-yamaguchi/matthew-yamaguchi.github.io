##My Javascript Experience
I've been using Javascript for about a week and I'm pretty comfortable using it.  One thing I found strange was the fact that variables aren't bound to a specific data type.  Javascript also allows the user to print variables to the console at will, unlike C and C++ that require conversion specifiers.  This makes printing to the console convenient for the user.  Javascript also allows the user to run code without having a main class.  I think Javascript is a great programming language as its syntax is simple and flexible, which allows the user to adapt to what they wish to accomplish.  The simple syntax makes it user friendly and easy for people to pick up.

##My "Athetlic Software Engineering" Experience
In regards to our class layout, I really like this style of athletic software engineering.  One problem I've had with other computer science courses was forgetting syntax of specific code.  If we didn't use a specific concept often, I would end up forgetting about it a month later.  This style of constant practice helps me remember the concepts by making it second nature.  I go through the practice WODs almost every day so I can practice key concepts.  The in class WODs can be stressful because you're playing against the clock and it's all or nothing.  However, the WODs seem to be fair (so far) and if you're prepared you will do well.

There are a few downfalls I see about this style of learning.  One drawback is being unsure of what concepts are important.  When the instructor gives you their personal thoughts on a concept, it makes it easier for the student to understand what the key concepts are.  With this style of learning, if you missed something in the notes you may suffer if it pops up on an assignment.  Another drawback is the high stress involved.  Some people perform better under pressure and others can't handle it.  For those who don't perform well under pressure, this can be seen as an opportunity to be exposed to some light stress.  However, this can also damage the confidence of some students who are having troubles and discourage them from continuing in this field.
