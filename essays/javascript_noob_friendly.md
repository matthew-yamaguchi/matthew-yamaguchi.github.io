I've been using Javascript for about a week and I'm pretty comfortable using it.  One thing I found strange was the fact that variables aren't bound to a specific data type.  Javascript also allows the user to print variables to the console at will, unlike C and C++ that require conversion specifiers.  This makes printing to the console convenient for the user.  Javascript also allows the user to run code without having a main class.  I think Javascript is a great programming language as its syntax is simple and flexible, which allows the user to adapt to what they wish to accomplish.  The simple syntax makes it user friendly and easy for people to pick up.
