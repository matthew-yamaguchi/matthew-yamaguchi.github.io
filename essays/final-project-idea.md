# Idea: Book Craigslist for UHM #
## Overview ##
### The Problem ###
UHM students spend a lot of money on textbooks every semester.  Selling textbooks back to the bookstores refunds the students a small fraction of the original price of the book.

### The Solution ###
To help students save money, they can sell their books to other students who need those textbooks in the coming semesters.

## Mockup page ideas ##
* Landing - Description of the application along with log in and register buttons.

* Profile - Shows a description of the user, their rating, books sold, contact information, and an optional photo.  The user must be verified.

* List of books - Offered books and wanted books.

* Search page - Filter wanted and owned books.

## Case Ideas ##
1.) User enters the site and logs into their account

2.) User searches for the book they need / posts the books they have

3.) User finds an offer / finds someone who needs the book they have

4.) Information is exchanged and a safe meet up is planned.

## Beyond the Basics ##
* Automated pricing
* Image of owned book for condition check
* Auto-filling fields if user enters ISBN
