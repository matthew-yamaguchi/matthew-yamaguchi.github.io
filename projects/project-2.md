For our final project in ICS 111, my partner and I created a game called "Birdo Does a Fly."  In our game, you control a bird that has to jump over bushes or duck underneath vines to escape from a fox.  Unfortunately for the bird, there's no way to "win" the game.  The main objective is to get the highest score that you can.  The game itself is simple, you can either jump or duck by pressing "w" and "s", respectively.  However, a simple mistake in input can leave you with no time to be able to dodge the next obstacle.  All the images were created by a friend outside of our ICS class, who I am very grateful to as they spent time out of their day to help make our project look beautiful.

I worked on the player (the bird) class and the main class, along with my partner.  The player class needed to have the capability to jump and duck.  The object also needed to display different images based on what it was doing.  For example, it needed to show the correct images while jumping, walking, ducking, and falling.
Vacay is implemented using [Meteor](http://meteor.com), a JavaScript application platform. Within two weeks, we created a website that implements several types of reservations including flights, hotels, and car rentals.

In this project I gained experience with full-stack web application design and associated technologies, including [MongoDB](http://mongodb.com) for database storage, the [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) CSS Framework for the user interface, and Javascript for both client and server-side programming.
